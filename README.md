# Apple Store Clone – Aditya Bainsla

This repository contains an **Apple Store website clone** I built a long time ago right after I finished giving all my competitive exams.  
It’s a static front-end site created to practice layout, design, and CSS techniques while exploring HTML and CSS basics.

## 🧱 Project Contents

- **index.html** – Main page of the Apple Store clone  
- **apple.css** – CSS styling for layout and visuals  
- **Images & assets** – Product images, icons, and section visuals  

## 📌 What I Worked On

This project helped me understand:
- HTML page structure  
- CSS styling fundamentals  
- Grid and layout practices  
- Using external assets like images  
- Building static website sections similar to a real e-commerce layout  

## 🎯 Purpose & Journey

I built this early in my web development journey as a practice project and to challenge myself to create a clean UI similar to Apple’s online store.  
Now I’m revisiting and sharing it to track how far I’ve come since then.

## 🤝 Feedback Welcome

This project was an early learning step — feedback and suggestions are welcome!
